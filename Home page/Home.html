       <!--About me secton this has information about who I am-->
            <p class="whoami">Hello, I'm Blake Gillanders, a 20-year-old who has spent the majority of my life in the picturesque town of Nelson, New Zealand. Welcome to my evolving
                 portfolio. While it's still in its infancy, this website represents a significant milestone in my coding journey, serving as my inaugural project for Web504. Through
                  this endeavor, I'm actively mastering HTML, CSS, and eagerly anticipating delving into JavaScript.

                Before I delve into my academic pursuits, let me share a bit about my background. I came into this world on August 29th, 2002, in the quaint town of Okiwi Bay, 
                nestled within the serene Marlborough Sounds. Although my memories of those early days are hazy, my family relocated to Nelson just six months later, setting the 
                stage for my formative years.
                
                Nelson Central School marked my first foray into the world of computers. My initial interactions involved video games, sparking an enduring fascination with technology
                . Fast forward to the age of 13, when my best friend embarked on building his first PC. Our collective lack of knowledge culminated in a functional but glitch-ridden 
                result. Intrigued by the process, I saved diligently to construct my own PC a year later, this time with a deeper understanding. This endeavor ignited my genuine passion
                 for computers, driving me to run a YouTube channel that flourished with 10,000 subscribers at its zenith. There, I honed skills in software like Sony Vegas Pro 13 and 
                 Adobe Photoshop CS6, forming the bedrock of my multimedia expertise.
                
                However, as adulthood beckoned, I took on a full-time job at a factory while grappling with my future aspirations. A year later, I met my fiancée, Pallas (pictured on 
                the left at the top of this page). As our relationship blossomed, we embarked on a journey together, and I made the impromptu decision to part with my beloved setup.
                 Six months later, I found myself yearning to reconnect with my tech roots.
                
                This journey led me to explore various career paths, including a stint as an engineer's assistant, where I delved into fabrication and welding. While instructive, it 
                became evident that it wasn't my ultimate calling. Subsequently, I ventured into 'Van and a Man,' initially with hopes of securing a Class 2 license. After a few clashes
                 with the boss, I returned to my previous job, contemplating my next move. It was during this period that I stumbled upon the 'Bachelor of IT' program at NMIT.
                
                Driven by curiosity, I delved into the world of coding, initially through platforms like 'freeCodeCamp' and 'Codecademy.' The allure of web development and software 
                creation beckoned, and I took the plunge by investing in a powerful laptop. Shortly thereafter, I received acceptance into NMIT, cementing my commitment to the world
                 of IT. I've embarked on a journey to acquire coding skills while meticulously crafting this website.
                
                Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you enjoy your stay, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect. Cheers!

            <p class="am3p">What are my goals with this website?... So to start things off this website will be changing alot over the next couple of years and you will be able to see all those
                changes in the update log section which is just to the left. the ultimate goal for this website is to make it look professional as my coding and designing skills improve.
            I want this website to be a HUB for all my life acheivements and all my completed assignments for my degree. This "website" is also my portfolio so it will be a way for anyone
        to get to know me better before they meet me so you will find a detailed backstory to my life highlighting all my milestones and achievements. So what is my current goal?, My current
    goal is to add java script functionality to the website so Im currently learning how java works and how to write code in java so I have some pretty basic functionality so far like my
calculator in my personal projects tab on the <a href="https://blakesg.github.io/BlakeGPortfolio/Projects%20page/projects.html#S5"> projects page</a> and the working comments section just below here but I
want to add some more advanced features like the search feature on the navigation bar. I'm currently working towards getting it to function like any other search bar so you enter your 
keywords and are prompted with results and then you select a result and it redirects you to your desired destination. If you have any other ideas for my website let me know through the
<a href="https://blakesg.github.io/BlakeGPortfolio/Contact%20page/Contactme.html">contacts page</a> or if you would simply like to get in touch you can also contact me there. </p>
